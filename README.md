# data-mapping-woot-and-shipstation
This is an interactive notebook for transforming data to feed into both of each platform bidirectionally. 
We provide a guideline for importing orders in Bulk from Woot to Shipstation's manual orders without EDI and API.

First, we need to map the fields of the purchase orders from Woot Dropship Portal to the Shipstation in order to print the shipping labels.
Second, after printing the labels and ship the products out, we need to upload the tracking number back to Woot's portal so we can get payment. This action also needs to apply data mapping for shipments data from Shipstation.
